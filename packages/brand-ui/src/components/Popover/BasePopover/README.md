# VTEX Components Popover

Elementary popover component that can be reused by all VTEX Styleguides.
You can use reakit full features (except the 'as' prop) and theme-ui's sx.
It renders a popover element by default.

> This is a styled base component, so any system can theme it. To customize this component, you just need to add the `popover` variant in your theme (check the [theming](#-theming) section).

## Usage

```jsx
import { Popover, usePopoverState } from '.*/BasePopover'

function UseCase() {
  const popover = usePopoverState()

  return (
    <Popover
      {...popover}
      disclosure={<button>Open popover</button>}
    >
      <p>This is a Popover</p>
    </Popover>
  )
}
```

### With arrow

If you want your popover to have an arrow, you can pass it to the popover as a prop. On the following example,
it's shown how you can use the Reakit [Reakit PopoverArrow](https://reakit.io/docs/popover/#popoverarrow) with the popover, but you can design any arrow you want.
The popover state is passed to the arrow, so you can access the placement and visibility of the popover.
