# Summary

`Popover` is a non-modal dialog that floats around its disclosure. Popovers contains helpful information such as an explanation of a context.

# Basic example

```jsx
import { Popover, usePopoverState } from '@vtex-component/popover'

const Example = () => {
  const popover = usePopoverState()

  return (
    <Popover
      {...popover}
      size="small"
      disclosure={<button>Open popover</button>}
    >
      <p>This is a Popover</p>
    </Popover>
  )
}
```

# Detailed design

| prop       | type        | description                                           | default | required |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| disclosure | ReactNode   | element that triggers the popover                     | -       | ✔️       |
| size       | PopoverSize | sizing of the popover                                 | regular | 🚫       |
| placement  | Placement   | the placement of the popover relative to its children | top     | 🚫       |
| arrow      | Boolean     | whether the popover will have an arrow or not         | false   | 🚫       |

PopoverSize = `'small'` | `'regular'`  
Placement = `"auto-start" | "auto" | "auto-end" | "top-start" | "top" | "top-end" | "right-start" | "right" | "right-end" | "bottom-end" | "bottom" | "bottom-start" | "left-end" | "left" | "left-start"`

# Adoption strategy

- This is a new feature, there are no breaking changes to any packages in `onda`.

# Education

- As with any DS component, it must be documented.

# Unresolved questions

- Missing specification about positioning the Popover.
- Missing other usage examples.
